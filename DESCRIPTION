Description: Adds a high-level interface for Keras neural nets with kms(), which builds and fits a keras_sequential_model (or, optionally, allows the user to pass a compiled model) based on an R formula. 
    kms accepts a number of parameters (like loss, optimizer, and Nepochs) and splits the data into test and training sparse matrices (from library Matrix). kms returns a single object with predictions, a confusion matrix, as well as details about the function call.
